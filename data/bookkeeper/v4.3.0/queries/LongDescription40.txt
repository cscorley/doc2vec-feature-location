To repro:
true; while [ $? = 0 ]; do mvn test -Dtest=BookieClientTest; done

Problem seems to be


        BookieClient bc = new BookieClient(channelFactory, executor);
        ChannelBuffer bb;
        bb = createByteBuffer(1, 1, 1);
        bc.addEntry(addr, 1, passwd, 1, bb, wrcb, null);
        synchronized (arc) {
            bc.readEntry(addr, 1, 1, recb, arc);



The test doesn't wait for addEntry to complete before doing a read. It should be simple to fix.
