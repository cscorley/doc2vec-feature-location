Just seen the peice of code in Jouranl#rollLog 


try {
                    FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
                    fos.write(buff);
                    fos.getChannel().force(true);
                    fos.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    LOG.error("Problems writing to " + file, e);
                }



On exception It is just logging and continuing.
Even though FileOutputStream provides finalize implementation and which will clean streams, I don't think it's a good idea to depend on it as it will not be garanteed.

cleaning with more care would avoid this.
