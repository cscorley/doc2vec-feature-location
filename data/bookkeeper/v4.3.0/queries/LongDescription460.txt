A minor problem, it seems forgot to update LedgerDeleteTest after upgrade bookkeeper filesystem.


// Verify that the first entry log (0.log) has been deleted from all of the Bookie Servers.
for (File ledgerDirectory : tmpDirs) {
    for (File f : ledgerDirectory.listFiles()) {
        assertFalse("Found the entry log file (0.log) that should have been deleted in ledgerDirectory: " 
            + ledgerDirectory, f.isFile() && f.getName().equals("0.log"));
    }
}

 
Solution:
Just reuse the checkLogFiles method in CompactionTest.
