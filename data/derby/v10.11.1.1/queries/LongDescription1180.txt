If you run the VerifySignatures test, you will see a lot of JDBC4 methods which don't appear in our implementation yet. We need to add vacuous implementations for these methods which raise SQLFeatureNotSupportedExceptions. Most of these methods won't need any more attention because they refer to features (like xml and national strings) which we don't support. We will open additional JIRAs for the methods which need non-vacuous implementations.
