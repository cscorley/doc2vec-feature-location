The antiGC thread was originally created to avoid the DriverManager class being garbage collected when no refrences existed to it and it had loaded the embedded JDBC driver (and hence shutting down the engine). This was an issue with JDK 1.1. Since Derby does not support jdk1.1 and garbage collection of classes is clearly defined, it is possible the thread serves no useful purpose.
