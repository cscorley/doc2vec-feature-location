When streaming data to Derby, the application stream will be wrapped in a Derby-specific stream to convert the data to the correct representation. At a minimum, this consists of getting the data to the on-disk format used by Derby.

The wrapping stream can be extended to provide the following features at an earlier stage:
 a) Data cut-off when the maximum allowed size is exceeded
 b) Truncation of trailing blanks where allowed

Both features can reduce the amount of data needed to be kept in memory on insertion.
Implementing this will require additional column/data type information in the streaming class(es). The implementation must be able to handle streams for which the length is specified and also streams with unknown/unspecified length.
