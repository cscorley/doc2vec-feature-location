You currently can't use a correlation ID in an UPDATE/DELETE statement. This makes it cumbersome to do the following:

UPDATE EMPLOYEE_BONUS
  SET BONUS = (SELECT SUM(BONUSES.BONUS) FROM BONUSES WHERE 
          EMPLOYEE_BONUS.EMPL_ID = BONUSES.EMPL_ID);

The use of a correlation ID makes this easier to code.

UPDATE EMPLOYEE E
  SET BONUS = (SELECT SUM(B.BONUS) FROM BONUSES B WHERE B.EMPL_ID = E.EMPL_ID);

This is particularly important if you get carried away with long SCHEMA and TABLE names!
