Derby presently does not implement support for the method
PreparedStatement.setObject (and similarly for CallableStatement.setObject) 
when the supplied value is null, unless a type argument (3rd arg) is also present. 
That is, in:
    void setObject(int parameterIndex,
                              Object x)
                              throws SQLException
x can not be null. 

Derby will presently throw an SQLException (client: XJ021, embedded: 22005)
if x is null when calling this method on a preparedStatement.

Porting some applications may be made easier if this restriction is lifted.
