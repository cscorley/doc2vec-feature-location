Since this is compilinga statement returning the specific node makes more sense and will lead to a little more clarity in the code.
Some of the methods defined on QueryTreeNode such as generate() and needsSavepoint() can move down to StatementNode and thus make the code more readable ("which generate is called for a value node?") and remove implementations of these methods that can never be called.
