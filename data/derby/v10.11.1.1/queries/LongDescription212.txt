In reviewing the Network Server Code and profiling there were 
several areas that showed potential for providing performance 
improvement.

Functions that need optimizing to prevent unneeded object 
creation and excessive decoding
parsePKGNAMCSN()
parseSQLDTA_work()
buildDB2CursorName()


In DDMWriter and DDMReader, use System Routines in 
java.util.Arrays and System.arrayCopy instead of 
writing code to do functions like copy arrays and 
pad strings.
