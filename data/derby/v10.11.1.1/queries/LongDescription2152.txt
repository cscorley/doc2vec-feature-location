Expand the work of DERBY-571 to support the remaining diagnostic tables that take parameters.

Syntax would use the table constructor, like (not sure if an 'AS' clause will be required:

select * from TABLE(SYSCS_DIAG.SPACE_TABLE(?, ?))

Diagnostic VTIs that could be handled this way are:

ErrorLogReader(String log file name)
SpaceTable(String tableName)
SpaceTable(String schemaName, String tableName)
StatementDuration(String inputFileName)

This is the second stage mentioned in DERBY-571
