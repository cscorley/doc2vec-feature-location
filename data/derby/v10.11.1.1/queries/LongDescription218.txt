Dan Debrunner posted a fix to allow for relaxed durability changes in http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.db.derby.user/681/match=relaxed+durability

1) Need to add this option in Derby maybe as some property

2) Also from discussions on the list, Mike suggested that 

	that the logging system be changed to somehow
record that the database has operated in this manner, so that if
the database goes corrupt we don't waste effort trying to figure out
what when wrong.  Probably need some way to mark the log records, the
log control file and write a message to the user error log file.
