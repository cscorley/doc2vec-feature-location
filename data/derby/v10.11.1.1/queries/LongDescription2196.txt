From an e-mail discussion:
... Derby should match the security  provided by typical client server systems such as DB2, Oracle, etc. I 
think in this case system/database owners are trusting the database 
system to ensure that their system cannot be attacked. So maybe if Derby 
is booted as a standalone server with no security manager involved, it 
should install one with a default security policy. Thus allowing Derby 
to use Java security manager to manage system privileges but not 
requiring everyone to become familiar with them.

I imagine such a policy would allow any access to databases under derby.system.home and/or user.home.
By standalone I mean the network server was started though the main() method (command line).
