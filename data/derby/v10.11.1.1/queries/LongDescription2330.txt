Disallowing routines from accessing Derby code directly stops the potential of remote code exploiting any security holes in Derby.

Derby code can be seen as a special case since it is known that the Derby code will be on the classpath.

Disallowing such routines makes security analysis easier and safer rather than trying to guarantee every public static method in Derby can not expose secured information.

Routines in existing applications (in upgraded databases) that map to such Derby methods will fail at execute time.
