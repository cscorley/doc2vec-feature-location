Default SSL behaviour is to require serer authentication. For a database application this is not as important as it is for web browsers and also creates som extra hassle for the user/application programmer. Since the main objective for SSL in Derby is encryption on the wire, server authentication should be optional (the same way client authentication is).

This also creates some symmetry which can be exploited to simplify the user interfce somewhat. This improvement to DERBY-2108 is described in the attached functional specification. See the attachment for details.
