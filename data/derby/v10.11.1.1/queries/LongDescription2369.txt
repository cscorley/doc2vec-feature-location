The shutdown command takes at least 1.5 seconds, broken into two parts:


	0.5 seconds is the first sleep after the shutdown request and before the first ping to see if the server is shutdown.




	~1 second is the time trying to obtain a socket in order to perform the ping to see if the server is shutdown. This socket creation fails (correctly) but takes time to do so.



The socket creation time can be avoided by re-using the socket that was used to send the shutdown request.

The sleep time could be reduced by sleeping on a finer granularity, 0.5secs is a long time for a modern processor.
