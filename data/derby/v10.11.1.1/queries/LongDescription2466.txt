The spec attached to DERBY-2109 describes how to allow the policy file to be dynamically reloaded while a server is running: We add a getPolicy permission to the Basic policy and we add a DBA-owned system procedure, SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_REFRESH_SECURITY_POLICY(), which reloads the policy file. This JIRA tracks that work.
