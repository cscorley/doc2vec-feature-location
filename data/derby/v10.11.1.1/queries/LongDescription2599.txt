DTD has TypeDescriptorImpl in it which has 2 new fields, namely, collationType and collationDerivation. These 2 fields are available for all different types of DTDs but only apply to character types. The other datatypes should ignore these 2 fields.

This Jira is a placeholder for loading the correct values into collationType and collationDerivation.
