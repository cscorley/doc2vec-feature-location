Add procedure & function to set (and get ) a user's connection authorization to full access, read-only or not defined.
Based upon the existing UserUtility class but only exposing a single procedure that sets the permission. This is to avoid any appearance that the procedure adds a user.

SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_SET_USER_ACCESS(VARCHAR(128) USERNAME, VARCHAR(8) CONNECTION_PERMISSION)

Valid values for  CONNECTION_PERMISSION

FULL - Add the user to the list of full access users for the database, i.e. the database property derby.database.fullAccessUsers)
READONLY - - Add the user to the list of read-only  users for the database, i.e. the database property derby.database.readOnlyAccessUsers)
NULL - remove the user from the list of permissions, reverting it to the default permission.

SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_GET_USER_ACCESS(VARCHAR(128) USERNAME) RETURNS VARCHAR(8)

Gets the current connection access permissions for the user, factors in the default connection mode.

Return either FULL, READONLY, NO or NULL.

(NO means connection attempt by user will be denied by the user not having an entry in derby.database.fullAccessUsers or derby.database.readOnlyAccessUsers and derby.database.defaultConnectionMode is set to noAccess)

The names of the connection permissions match the existing names in use by Derby.
