If Network Client cannot connect to the database to retrieve an error message, it will print only the message tokens, the non-ascii token separators, and derby log location.  It would be good if at least the message could be formatted to present a better message to the user without the non-ascii characters.


To reproduce try a database shutdown.  Because the database is shutdown, the client cannot retrieve the actual message from the server. It therefore just prints the tokens.

Start network server

java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start

$ java org.apache.derby.tools.ij
ij version 10.1
ij> connect 'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/wombat;create=true';
ij> connect 'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/wombat;shutdown=true';
ERROR 08006: DERBY SQL error: SQLCODE: -1, SQLSTATE: 08006, SQLERRMC: wombat[]08006.D[]Database 'wombat' shutdown.[](server log:derby.log)

Note: The actual offending characters have been replaced in the output in this bug by []. This is because they break Jira XML retrieval!
