Each time a transaction is committed or aborted, GenericLanguageConnectionContext.resetSavepoints() goes through the stack of statement contexts and invokes resetSavePoint() on them. Instead of traversing the list in the CtxStack object directly, it fetches a read-only view of the list. Since the lifetime of a CtxStack object and the list within it can span multiple transactions, the read-only view only needs to be created the first time CtxStack.getUnmodifiableList() is called on an object.
