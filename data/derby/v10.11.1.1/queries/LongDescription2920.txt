Most of the implementations of DataValueDescriptor.readExternalFromArray(ArrayInputStream) are identical to their corresponding Externalizable.readExternal(ObjectInput) methods. Since ArrayInputStream implements ObjectInput, readExternalFromArray() could in those cases just have forwarded calls to readExternal() instead of duplicating the code. A default forwarding implementation of readExternalFromArray() could be placed in org.apache.derby.iapi.types.DataType, and all the existing implementations, except those with optimizations for ArrayInputStream, could be removed.
