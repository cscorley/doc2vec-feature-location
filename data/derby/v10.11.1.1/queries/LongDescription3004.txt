Finalizers make object allocation and garbage collection more expensive and should be avoided for object types that are frequently allocated. EmbedResultSet has a finalize() method and is frequently allocated for many types of load. The following comment was posted on DERBY-1876:

By commenting out the finalize() method in EmbedResultSet, the time to run the test on my laptop is reduced from ~3 seconds to ~1.3 seconds (OpenSolaris, Sun Java SE 6). Since the finalizer is a no-op if the activation isn't single-use, I think we should investigate whether there are ways to avoid this cost for ResultSets that don't need the finalizer.
