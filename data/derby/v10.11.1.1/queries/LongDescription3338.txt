Minor issue but CancelQueryTask.forgetContext() has this code (in GenericStatementContext.java)

        public void forgetContext() {
            boolean mayStillRun = !cancel();
            if (mayStillRun) {
                synchronized (this) 
{
                    statementContext = null;
                }
            }
        }

The mayStillRun = !cancel() is somewhat confusing. I can't see from the javadoc of TimerTask.cancel() how its return value could indicate the task may still run.
Less confusing code could be:

        public void forgetContext() {
               synchronized (this) {                    statementContext = null;                }
                cancel();
        }
