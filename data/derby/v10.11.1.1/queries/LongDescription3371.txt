RAMTransaction.addColumnToConglomerate() contains this piece of code:

            // remove old entry in the Conglomerate directory, and add new one
			if (tempCongloms != null)
				tempCongloms.remove(new Long(conglomId));
			tempCongloms.put(new Long(conglomId), conglom);

1. According to the code coverage report (http://people.apache.org/~fuzzylogic/codecoverage/529822/_files/3fc.html#5) these lines are not tested. If possible, a test that covers them should be added to the regression suite.

2. The null check looks either unnecessary (seems to be the case after a brief inspection of the code), or incomplete since the last line will throw a NullPointerException regardless of the check if tempCongloms is null.

3. The call to remove() before put() is redundant, since HashMap.put() will remove the old mapping implicitly.

4. It seems to me that the object that is put into the HashMap always is the same as the one that is removed, so perhaps all these lines could be deleted.
