The asynchronous replication functionality writes information to the derby log. It would be good to improve this in the following ways:

1: startSlave and stopSlave stack traces are written twice to the log - one is obviously enough 
2: It should be possible to configure if replication messages written to the log should be followed by a stack trace of the cause.
3: logged messages should have a timestamp
