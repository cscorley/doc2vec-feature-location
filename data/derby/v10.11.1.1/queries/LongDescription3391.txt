CompilerContext saves the isolation level of the LanguageConnectionContext (LCC) when it is pushed and restores it when it is popped. However there is no mechanism for the isolation level to change during compilation. Isolation level can only be changed by a Connection.setTransactionIsolation() or the SET ISOLATION SQL statement.
