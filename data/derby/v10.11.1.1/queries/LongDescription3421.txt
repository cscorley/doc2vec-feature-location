The client driver has code for caching connect bytes, but it is not used.
This unused code clutters the rest of the code and makes it harder to understand.

Secondly, the variable used to determine if the cached connect bytes can be used is public in am.Connection.

If someone has historic information about this feature, it would be nice if they could add the information to this Jira.
