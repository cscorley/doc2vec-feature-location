One side effect is that the toString() of such a warning would change format from starting with "SQLWarning: " to "java.sql.SQLWarning: ", which should match any warnings created on the network client side.

See comments in DERBY-3453 as well for possible correct package of SQLWarningFactory.

Note: generateCsSQLWarning() can be removed as it doesn't seem to be used.

Note: Also SQLWarningFactory would not extend java.sql.SQLWarning.
