The DrdaStreamOutBufferSize attribute of org.apache.derby.mbeans.drda.NetworkServerMBean is currently of type String. The value of this attribute describes the size of the buffer for streaming blob/clob from server to client (derby.drda.streamOutBufferSize property), and is handled as an integer (int) in the DDMWriter class of the Network Server.

The type was changed to int in the functional specification of DERBY-1387 [1], since no reason was found for this to be a String. Similar attributes, such as DrdaMaxThreads, have return type int. It may useful for a JMX client to know that the value should be an int instead of just any arbitrary string; hence this change.
