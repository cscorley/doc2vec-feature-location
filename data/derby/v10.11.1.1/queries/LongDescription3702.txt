Knut Anders raised the issue of whether we still need this jar file: http://www.nabble.com/Is-xml-apis.jar-still-needed--td17584026.html#a17584026 I have built Derby without this jar file and run the regression tests under Java 5 and jdk1.4: they passed cleanly for me in both environments. I believe we can remove this jar file, which was added in revision 395643 in order to compile the xml support under jdk1.3--we no longer support that platform.
