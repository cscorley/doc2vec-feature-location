I have sometimes seen in a profiler that an unreasonably high amount of the CPU time is spent in GenericLanguageConnectionContext.lookupCursorActivation() when the network server is running. That method is used to check that there is no active statement in the current transaction with the same cursor name as the statement currently being executed, and it is normally only used if the executing statement has a cursor name. None of the client-side statements had a cursor name when I saw this.

The method is always called when the network server executes a statement because the network server assigns a cursor name to each statement even if no cursor name has been set on the client side. If the list of open statements is short, the method is relatively cheap. If one uses ClientConnectionPoolDataSource with the JDBC statement cache, the list of open statements can however be quite long, and lookupCursorActivation() needs to spend a fair amount of time iterating over the list and comparing strings.

The time spent looking for duplicate names in lookupCursorActivation() is actually wasted time when it is called from the network server, since the network server assigns unique names to the statements it executes, even when there are duplicate names on the client. It would be good if we could reduce the cost of this operation, or perhaps eliminate it completely when the client doesn't use cursor names.
