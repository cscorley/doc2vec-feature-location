Derby objects if you try to declare a function or procedure with an argument whose type is BLOB or CLOB. These kinds of arguments are allowed in the SQL standard and the matching Java types are java.sql.Blob and java.sql.Clob. See the SignatureMatching.html summary attached to DERBY-3652.

We should lift this restriction and allow functions and procedures to take large object arguments.
