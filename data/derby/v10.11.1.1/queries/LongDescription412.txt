After the change for DERBY-243 the  connection toString() output is  an integer which correspond to SESSIONID.  The output should identify the type and also the meaning of the identifier that it prints.  Perhaps a format that appends the default toString output with the sessionid information as it prints in the derby.log would be more informative.

org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.EmbedConnection@efd552 (SESSONID = 2)


Ultimately this could be expanded to included other diagnostic information e.g

org.apache.derby.impl.jdbc.EmbedConnection@efd552 (XID = 132), (SESSIONID = 5), (DATABASE = wombat), (DRDAID = NF000001.H324-940125304405039114
{7}
)
