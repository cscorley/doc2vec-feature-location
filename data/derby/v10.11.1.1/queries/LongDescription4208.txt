The new OFFSET/FETCH syntax does not support Parameters. 

From ij against the toursdb I would like to do the following:

    ij> prepare foo as 'select * from cities offset ? rows fetch first 10 rows only';

but results in the following syntax error: 

    ERROR 42X01: Syntax error: Encountered "?" at line 1, column 29.

Parameterized OFFSET/FETCH is important for performance (can be prepared) and security (SQL strings not created on the fly).
