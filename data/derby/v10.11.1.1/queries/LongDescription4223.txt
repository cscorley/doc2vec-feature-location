Currently, the system properties aren't being used by the runScript() method on the org.apache.derby.tools.ij

This raises an issue with allowing the port used for the JUnit tests to be customized, therefore blocking DERBY-4217. The idea, was to allow properties such as ij.protocol to be set either as system properties, or in a Properties object, then passed to the runScript() method.

Please share any thoughts and ideas as to which may be the best approach.
