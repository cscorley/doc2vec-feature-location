While working on DERBY-4053, found that an exception from Connection.close was not handled properly by the server shutdown code which caused a new instance server startup to hang. Resolved the problem with Connection close but in general, we should
1) Make sure an exception during shutdown processing does not prevent the remaining shutdown tasks, like closing the server socket from occurring. 
2) Make sure any exceptions that occur in shutdown processing are reported to the console.
