A pattern in Derby is to use the following piece of code to determine if the data value has a stream or not:
    if (dvd.getStream() != null) ...

Since the stream has mutable state, obtaining a reference to it just to check if it is not null is sub-optimal for several reasons:

	it may throw an exception (data types not supporting streams)
	the stream reference is leaked, which is unfortunately if we are / will be required to guarantee something about the stream state (for instance that the descriptor is in sync with the stream).
	in cases where we have to investigate the state of the stream, we're doing unnecessary work
	makes it harder to write debug code (i.e., is a stream reference obtained from the data value descriptor more than once?)



I plan to introduce the method DataValueDescriptor.hasStream, returning a boolean.
In addition to the obvious check if the stream variable is non-null, it can also be used to instruct Derby to treat certain data values as non-streams even though the underlying value is currently a stream. One example is CHAR and VARCHAR, whose maximum lengths are so small that they should always be materialized to avoid the added complexity coming with streams (stream state, isolation levels - extra lock to keep stream stable?, cloning).
