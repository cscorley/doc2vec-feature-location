Now that DERBY-700 has been fixed, some users upgrading to the 1.6 JVM are seeing an error on dual boot where they did not before (which is of course is a very good thing).  They  do however at that time need to diagnose where the dual boot is coming from which is sometimes harder than one might think with a complex system and legacy code.  It would be helpful to have a property that they could set which would print a stack trace on any boot attempt, even if successful,  to help diagnose the application error, maybe:

derby.stream.error.logBootTrace=true
