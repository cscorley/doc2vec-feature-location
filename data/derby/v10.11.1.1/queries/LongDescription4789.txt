Inserting from a table function is a lot like importing from a file:

1) Derby has limited visibility into the size of the external data source.

2) The user is often trying to import a large data set.

The import procedures assume that Derby should always apply the bulk-insert optimization when importing from a file. The same assumption seems reasonable whenever a table function appears in the source stream of an INSERT.
