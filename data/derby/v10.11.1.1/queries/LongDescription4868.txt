JVMInfo contains code to switch between using Types.BIT and Types.BOOLEAN based on the JVM version. This was needed when we supported Java 1.3, since Types.BOOLEAN was introduced in Java 1.4 and so Types.BIT had to be used instead on old platforms. Currently, all supported JDBC versions (including JSR-169 for small devices) have Types.BOOLEAN, so the code is no longer needed.
