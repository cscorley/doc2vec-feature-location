Currently, the Embedded Driver supports Statement.setQueryTimeout(), but the Client Driver does not. The Client Driver should be enhanced and match the Embedded Driver.

For this, we need to transfer the timeout value from the client to the server, preferably without a separate round-trip. I have some loose thoughts on how to do this:


	If the client has set a timeout value for a statement, prepend the (DRDA) EXCSQLSTT command with an EXCSQLSET command which contains the timeout value; conceptually a "SET STATEMENT TIMEOUT <seconds>" (this does not mean that we need to extend the Derby grammar; only the Network Server needs to understand this DRDA EXCSQLSET command).
	In DRDAConnThread.parseEXCSQLSETobjects() on the server side, recognize the "SET STATEMENT TIMEOUT" text, parse the timeout value and remember it for the coming EXCSQLSTT command. Do NOT invoke executeUpdate() with the SET statement [see note below].
	In DRDAConnThread.parseEXCSQLSTT(), check if a timeout value has been set; if so, use it (by setting the timeout value on the server-side Statement object before calling execute/executeQuery).
