Most critical information from sysinfo is now available in the Derby boot message in derby.log, except  for the operating system information.
e.g.

OS name: Windows XP
OS architecture: x86
OS version: 5.1 build 2600 Service Pack 3 

It would be useful to log the operating system info as well in the derby.log on boot.

I'll close out DERBY-1272 after filing this issue as this is the last piece of info that needs to be added to the error  log.
