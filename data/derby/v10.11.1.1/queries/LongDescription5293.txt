DataDictionaryImpl and CreateTriggerNode contain implementations of bubble sort that could be replaced by calls to Collections.sort(). This isn't performance critical code (it's only used for sorting vectors of column references or table nodes at compile time) so there shouldn't be much to gain by hand-coding the sorting. Using Collections.sort() has the benefits that it results in less code and that the implementation has probably gone through more testing than our hand-coded one.
