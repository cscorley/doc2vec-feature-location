Support use of the WHEN clause in CREATE TRIGGER statements. The clause is described in the SQL standard (2003) in chapter "11.39 <trigger definition>" under "<triggered action>".

There are traces in the code that suggests some work has been done on this earlier. If anyone knows something about this, please add a comment to this issue.
