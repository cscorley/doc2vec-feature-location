The following script shows the same value being returned from a sequence generator by two successive NEXT VALUE FOR calls. Thanks to Knut for finding this:

connect 'jdbc:derby:memory:db;create=true';

create table t (x int);
create sequence s;
autocommit off;
select count from sys.syssequences with rs;
values next value for s;
drop table t;
rollback;

– same value as previous call
values next value for s;
