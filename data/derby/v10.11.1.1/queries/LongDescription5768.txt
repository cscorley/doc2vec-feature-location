As a result of the spec change introduced by derby-866-22-aa-dboFirst.diff, it is no longer possible to directly set derby.authentication.provider to the value NATIVE::LOCAL. That setting only happens when the DBO stores her credentials. We should remove confusing references to NATIVE::LOCAL from Derby error messages.
