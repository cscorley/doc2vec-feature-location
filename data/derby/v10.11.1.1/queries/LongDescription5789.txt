Currently istat logs the affected table twice when dropping disposable statistics entries, but it doesn't log which index is affected at all.

This information is only useful when the user wants to understand what happened, i.e. was there an orphaned entry in the system or was the entry dropped because it was computed for a single-column primary key?
