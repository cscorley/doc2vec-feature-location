When looking at a test coverage report, I noticed that these methods in the SQLBoolean class are not tested:


	falseTruthValue
	trueTruthValue
	greaterOrEquals
	greaterThan
	lessOrEquals
	lessThan
	is
	isNot
	readExternal
	hashCode



falseTruthValue() and trueTruthValue() are never called anywhere in the code and could be removed.

is() and isNot() also have no callers. However, they implement the boolean IS operator which is part of the SQL standard, so it might make more sense to file a JIRA to add the syntax to the grammar rather than removing the methods.
