I've found that many methods that generate messages could be collapsed into a single method using varargs. Right now, many of them exist in multiple variants, typically for zero up to three or four message arguments.

Examples:
  Monitor.logTextMessage()
  MessageService.getTextMessage()
  Constructors in SqlException and SqlWarning
