I identified some unused code; a flag that is always false, and code for handling triggers in bulk insert which is unused (by inspection and corroborated by JaCoCo results for our regression tests): we disable bulk insert if there are triggers present, cf. 


	DMLModStatementNode#getAllRelevantTriggers ->
  adjustDeferredFlag(true)




	InsertResultSet#bulkInsert:



  bulkInsert = verifyBulkInsert()->
      :
      // bulk insert is disabled for deferred mode inserts
      if (constants.deferred)
      return false;
