Islay Symonette, in an email thread called "Storing Java Objects in a table" on October 26, 2005 requests the ability to store java objects in the database.

Old releases of Cloudscape allow users to declare a column's type to be a Serializable class. This feature was removed from Derby because the syntax was non-standard. However, most of the machinery to support objects serialized to columns is still in Derby and is even used in system tables. We need to agree on some standard syntax here and re-expose this useful feature. Some subset of the ANSI adt syntax, cumbersome as it is, would do.
