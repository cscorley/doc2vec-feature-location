Since JDK 7, when we use the standard decorator for JUnit tests, e.g.

return TestConfiguration.defaultSuite(AggBuiltinTest.class);

the order in which the test fixtures get run is indeterministic. This is undesirable because it doesn't add much coverage to the product and makes the tests more brittle than they need to be.
