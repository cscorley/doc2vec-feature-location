DRDAConnThread::doneData currently creates a new SQLException object that is passed to the writeSQLCAGRP() method. Profiling shows that the creation of these Exception objects takes a lot of CPU because the Throwable constructor will call fillInStackTrace(), which is expensive. This is unnecessary since the exception is not being thrown, and the stack trace is never used. 

It would be sufficient to keep a static SQLException instance in DRDAConnThread that could be reused each time doneData() is called (this is also suggested by the following comment in the code: 

// sqlstate 02000 for end of data.
// RESOLVE: Need statics for sqlcodes."

Assigning to Knut-Anders, since he has the patch ready  in his sandbox.
