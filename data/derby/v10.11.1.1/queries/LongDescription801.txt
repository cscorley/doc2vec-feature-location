Derby currently serializes accesses to a data file.  For example, the
implementation of RAFContainer.readPage is as follows:

    synchronized (this) 
{  // 'this' is a FileContainer, i.e. a file object
        fileData.seek(pageOffset);  // fileData is a RandomAccessFile
        fileData.readFully(pageData, 0, pageSize);
    }

I have experiemented with a patch where I have introduced several file
descriptors (RandomAccessFile objects) per RAFContainer.  These are
used for reading.  The principle is that when all readers are busy, a
readPage request will create a new reader.  (There is a maximum number
of readers.)  With this patch, throughput was improved by 50% on
linux.  For more discussion on this, see

The challenge with the suggested approach is to make a mechanism to
limit the number of open file descpriptors.  Mike Matrigali has
suggested to use the existing CacheManager infrastructure for this
purpose.  For a discussion on that, see:
