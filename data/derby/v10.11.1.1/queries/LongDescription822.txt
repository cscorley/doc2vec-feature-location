Currently, the client driver does not pre-fetch data when
executeQuery() is called, but it does on the first call to
ResultSet.next(). Pre-fetching data on executeQuery() would reduce
network traffic and improve performance.

The DRDA protocol supports this. From the description of OPNQRY (open
query):

  The qryrowset parameter specifies whether a rowset of rows is to be
  returned with the command.  This is only honored for non-dynamic
  scrollable cursors (QRYATTSNS not equal to QRYSNSDYN) and for
  non-scrollable cursors conforming to the limited block query
  protocol.  The target server fetches no more than the requested
  number of rows. It may fetch fewer rows if it is restricted by extra
  query block limits, or if a fetch operation results in a negative
  SQLSTATE or an SQLSTATE of 02000.
