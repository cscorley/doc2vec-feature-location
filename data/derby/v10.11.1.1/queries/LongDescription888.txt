Improve performance of page allocation by no longer requiring sync of the allocated pages.  The reason for the sync
currently is so that during redo recovery we did not have to handle the case of redoing the allocate and finding no space
available on the disk.   During tasks like single user load this sync allocation is a significant performance issue - in the
case where one does 1000 insert per transaction the total time aproaches very close to durability=test where no syncing
is done in the whole system.

For instance in a test of loading a 150 meg db with a number of tables and indexes, on a 1.7 ghz laptop with one ide disk,
sun jdk1.4.2, windows XP
i got the following types of results:
default system:  6 minutes
no alloc sync:      1 minute, 43 seconds
no syncing:          1 minute , 1 second

Once syncing is disabled then recovery must be enhanced to handle the possible out of space condition.  Recovery already
handles out of space during undo, so this will just handle the error the same as that.  It will stop recovery and produce an error
indicating that user must add disk space and rerun recovery before system can be brought online.  I actually think on most
JVM's/OS's this won't happen as the system will still be asking the JVM/OS for the space, just not syncing the values in those
pages to disk.  Most OS's at this point will reserve the space in the file tables and not let others grab that space.  

This project will make sure that out of space recovery path has tests.  It will also make sure that redo recovery encountering garbage
in a newly allocated page during redo of an create page is tested.
