Consider a simple case of  - 
A table tbl has 10000 rows, there is a primary key index on i1
and the query in question is 
 select * from tbl where i1 in (-1,100000)

derby does a table scan of the entire table even though the "IN" list has only two values and the comparison is on a field that has an index.

Briefly looking at the code, it seems like we insert a between and use the IN list to get the start and stop values for the scan. Thus the range of the values in the "IN" list here plays an important role. 

Thus if the query was changed to select * from tbl where i1 in (-1, 1), an index scan would be chosen.

It would be nice if we could do something clever in this case where there is clearly an index on the field and the number of values in the IN list is known. Maybe use the rowcount estimate and the IN list size to do some optimizations.  

	consider the length of the "IN" list to do searches on the table.  ie use the IN list values to do index key searches on the table,
-or try to convert it to a join. Use the "IN" list values to create a temporary table and do a join. It is most likely that the optimizer will choose the table with "IN" list here as the outer table in the join and thus will do key searches on the larger table.
