I meet a error after following these steps:- Remove hot keys Navigate->Open:F3 then add a new one Ctrl+Enter- Remove hot keys Edit->Find Previous:Ctrl+Shift+K then add a new one Shift+F3- Remove hot keys Edit->Find Next:Ctrl+K then add a new one F3 Everything work fine with the new assigned keys except for editing an ant file (build.xml). When editing ant file, the ui understand the old hot keys: F3 for open and Ctrl+K for Find Next.
