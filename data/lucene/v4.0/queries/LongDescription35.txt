If i do an AND search with an StandardAnalyzer the word 'it' (or better IT  
for infromation technology ) is cut out by the Analyzer. That is ok. I get no 
result. But wenn i search for 'it' and 'plus' (plus is not cut out by the 
analyzer). The result is empty, too. But that is not fine, of cause if i search 
only for 'plus' i get an result.
So, i think if an word is thrown away by the analyzer, this part of the and 
query should hava no affect to the rest of the search. It should left out by 
the BooleanQuery.
I hope it is easy to fix, because it has much affect of search result.
(I tryed do left out any Analyzer but that wasnt suitable ... sorry for my bad 
english)
