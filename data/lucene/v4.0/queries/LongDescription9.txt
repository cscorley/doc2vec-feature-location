I think there's "ideo-logic" error in QueryParser:
  (and in BooleanQuery!)

  when I search for smth. like "love OR NOT onion"
  I receive the same result as I search for "love AND NOT onion".
  IMHO it's wrong.

  Let we have 4 docs:
  doc1: "Love is life"
  doc2: "Java is pretty nice language"
  doc3: "C++ is powerful, but unsafe"
  doc4: "Onion and love sometimes are not compatoble"

  So, if search for "love OR NOT onion"
  result must be: doc1, doc2, doc3.
  (everything where the word "onion" isn't present, because we say "OR")

  but, we have the same result as in case of search for:
  "love AND NOT onion":
  result: doc1.


  So, I have created own parser, using BooleanQuery, that would help
  me, but unfortunatelly it wouldn't.

  Please ! Fix it ASAYK !
