According to the website's "Query Syntax" page, fuzzy searches are given a
boost of 0.2. I've found this not to be the case, and have seen situations where
exact matches have lower relevance scores than fuzzy matches.

Rather than getting a boost of 0.2, it appears that all variations on the term
are first found in the model, where dist* > 0.5.


	dist = levenshteinDistance / length of min(termlength, variantlength)



This then leads to a boolean OR search of all the variant terms, each of whose
boost is set to (dist - 0.5)*2 for that variant.

The upshot of all of this is that there are many cases where a fuzzy match will
get a higher relevance score than an exact match.

See this email for a test case to reproduce this anomalous behaviour.

Here is a candidate patch to address the issue -
