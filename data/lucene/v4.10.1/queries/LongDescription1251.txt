The close method just does this:


      if (isOpen) {
        super.close();
        file.close();
        isOpen = false;
      }



But super.close = BufferedIndexOutput.close, which tries to flush its buffer.  If disk is full (or something else is wrong) then we hit an exception and don't actually close the descriptor.

I will put a try/finally in so we always close, taking care to preserve the original exception. I'll commit shortly & backport to 2.3.2
