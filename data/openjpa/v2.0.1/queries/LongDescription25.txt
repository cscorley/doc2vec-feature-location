select e, d from EmpBean e, DeptBean d generates following SQL where t2 is undefined:
          SELECT t1.empid, t2.deptno FROM EmpBean t0 JOIN EmpBean t1 ON (1 = 1)
 'DeptBean t2' is missing in the FROM clause.
Similar problem occurs to the following query:
  select d from EmpBean e left join e.dept d, ProjectBean p where e.salary = p.budget ==> incorrect SQL (t3 is undefined): 
SELECT t1.deptno, t1.budget, t1.mgr_empid, t1.name, t1.reportsTo_deptno FROM EmpBean t0 LEFT OUTER JOIN DeptBean t1 ON t0.dept_deptno = t1.deptno JOIN EmpBean t2 ON (1 = 1) WHERE (t2.salary = t3.budget)
