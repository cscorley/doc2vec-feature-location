Right now, we have a ton of jars, most of which are needed to actually run OpenJPA. For real users, we should create aggregates of these jars, for example:


	openjpa-0.9.0-full.jar - contains all openjpa code, openjpa-*.jars merged |
	openjpa-0.9.0-nodep.jar - contains all openjpa code and all third party dependency jars |
