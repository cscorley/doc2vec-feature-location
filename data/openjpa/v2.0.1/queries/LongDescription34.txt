I have a small hierarchy of entities specified in an xml descriptor (orm.xml), Employee, PartTimeEmployee and FullTimeEmployee. PartTimeEmployee and FullTimeEmployee extend Employee which is a MappedSuperclass. 

If I don't explicitly set the access type for either PartTimeEmployee or FullTimeEmployee in orm.xml and I use the static enhancer (org.apache.openjpa.enhance.PCEnhancer) everything works fine.  If I use runtime enhancement I get a warning like this :

From what I can tell after running the debugger the error occurs because the runtime enhancer isn't able to find the parent's metadata (and from that the access type). 

I don't think the spec is very clear in this regard. Access isn't a required attribute for entities, but the spec doesn't indicate what should happen if it isn't present (or if it does I didn't find it). 

I don't know whether this is a limitation of runtime enhancement (again I didn't see it documented anywhere, but maybe I didn't look hard enough). There are also plenty of solutions, specifying a default access type in orm.xml, or just adding access="PROPERTY" to the entity will work. 

If it's not an architectural limitation though, I think we should try to get runtime enhancement to work in the same manner as static enhancement. 

In case it helps here's my javaagent setting : 
-javaagent:/home/mikedd/.m2/repository/org/apache/openjpa/openjpa-kernel-5/0.9.0-SNAPSHOT/openjpa-kernel-5-0.9.0-SNAPSHOT.jar=scanDevPath=true,MetaDataFactory=jpa

I've attached the source that I've used to produce the problem, include the eclipse .project and .classpath files (you'll probably have to update these). There's also a pom.xml which can be used to compile or at least set up the classpath in eclipse. I don't know how to toggle between runtime and static enhancement with maven so I haven't used it to run the tests.
