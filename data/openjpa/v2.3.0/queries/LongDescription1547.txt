With the following entities:

@Entity
public class EntityA 
{
	@Id
	int id;
	int age;
	String name;
}

@Entity
public class EntityB 
{
	@Id
	int id;
	int age;
       @PersistentCollection(fetch=FetchType.LAZY)
	String[] nickNames;
}

OpenJPA generates wrong SQL for the JPQL:
        String jpql = "SELECT a.name FROM EntityA a WHERE a.id not in " + 
        "(select b.id FROM EntityB b where ?1 MEMBER OF b.nickNames)";

SELECT t0.name FROM EntityA t0 
WHERE (0 = (SELECT COUNT FROM  
     WHERE (t0.id IN (
          SELECT t1.id 
	       FROM EntityB t1 
	       INNER JOIN EntityB_nickNames t2 ON t1.id = t2.ENTITYB_ID 
	       WHERE (t2.element = ?) )) ))  [params=(String) token1]

Note that if the JPQL is:
        String jpql = "SELECT a.name FROM EntityA a WHERE a.id in " + 
        "(select b.id FROM EntityB b where ?1 MEMBER OF b.nickNames)";

The push-down sql is correct:
SELECT t0.name FROM EntityA t0 
      WHERE (t0.id IN 
          (SELECT t1.id 
	        FROM EntityB t1 
		INNER JOIN EntityB_nickNames t2 ON t1.id = t2.ENTITYB_ID 
		WHERE (t2.element = ?) ));
