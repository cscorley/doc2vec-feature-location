I have an entity with a map element collection where the map value is an Embeddable.

@Embeddable
public class LocalizedString 
{

    private String language;
    private String string;

    // getters and setters omitted
}



@Entity
public class MultilingualString 
{

    @Id
    private long id;

    @ElementCollection(fetch=FetchType.EAGER)
    private Map<String, LocalizedString> map = new HashMap<String, LocalizedString>();
}


Given a persistent instance m of my entity, I update a member of a given map value and then merge the modified entity:

    EntityManager em = ...;
    em.getTransaction().begin();
    m.getMap().get("en").setString("foo");
    em.merge(m)
    em.getTransaction().commit();

The problem is, the state change of the map does not get saved to the database. With DEBUG logging on, I can see that the flush on commit does not trigger any SQL UPDATE.

To force the update, I have to put a new value into the map instead of just changing the existing one.

    EntityManager em = ...;
    em.getTransaction().begin();
    m.getMap().put("en"), new LocalizedString("en", "foo"));
    em.merge(m)
    em.getTransaction().commit();

After this change, I do see the expected UPDATE.

My Embeddable does have hashCode() and equals() implemented such that the changed map is not equal() to the former version in either case.

This looks like a bug in the dirty-checking logic in OpenJPA.
