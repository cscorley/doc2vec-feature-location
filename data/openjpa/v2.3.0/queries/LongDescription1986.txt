I found a scenario where extra queries were being generated while cascading a persist to a new Entity. See the following example:

@Entity
public class CascadePersistEntity implements Serializable 
{
    private static final long serialVersionUID = -8290604110046006897L;

    @Id
    long id;

    @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    CascadePersistEntity other;
...
}

and the following scenario:
CascadePersistEntity cpe1 = new CascadePersistEntity(1);
CascadePersistEntity cpe2 = new CascadePersistEntity(2);
cpe1.setOther(cpe2);
em.persist(cpe1);

This results in two inserts and one select. The extra select is what I'm going to get rid of with this JIRA.
