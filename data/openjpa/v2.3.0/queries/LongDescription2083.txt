The JPA 2.0 spec requires any non-static non-transient entity field to be persistent unless explicitly mapped as transient by a @Transient annotation or the equivalent XML.

OpenJPA 2.1.1 silently treats some unmapped non-primitive fields as transient instead of throwing an exception or at least logging a warning.

Example:

@Entity
public class City 
{

    @Id
    private String name;

    private Integer population;

    private java.util.concurrent.Executor executor;

    // getters and setters
}
