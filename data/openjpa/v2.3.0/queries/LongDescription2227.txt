I'm trying to use a custom SequenceGenerator within an enterprise application using openJPA (providing by WebSphere).

When defining a custom Sequence a ClassNotFoundException (for the Sequence class) will be thrown when trying to insert data into the database.

ExampleConfiguration:


@Entity
@SequenceGenerator(name="MySequence", sequenceName="org.apache.openjpa.generator.UIDGenerator()")
public class Customer implements Serializable {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator="MySequence")
    private long id;



The example will produce the stacktrace attached.

It seems that the wrong class loader is used to instantiate the custom sequence class. A very similar issue seems to be: OPENJPA-758. With JavaSE (JUnit) all is working fine, but after deploying into WAS the Exception will occur.

I think within the method SequenceMetaData.instantiate(Classloader envLoader) the JavaTypes.classForName() -method with parameter mustExist=false should be used instead of the pure Class.forName() call. But I'm not sure about the Metadata-parameter needed for this method call.
