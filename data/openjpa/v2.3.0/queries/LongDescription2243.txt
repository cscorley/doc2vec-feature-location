FormatPreservingProperties extends Properties, which is a thread-safe class, but it does not preserve the thread safety. This leads to surprising deadlocks if you have a reference of type Properties, because it may turn out to be not thread-safe (despite being documented as such).

Here's a simplified example that shows how we hit this bug:

final Properties p1 = new Properties();
final Properties p2 = createPropsWithDefault(p1);
p2.put(p2, p2);

Thread t1 = new Thread(new Runnable() {
  public void run() 
{ p2.remove(p1); }
});

Thread t2 = new Thread(new Runnable() {
  public void run() 
{ p2.stringPropertyNames(); }
});
t1.start();
t2.start();
try 
{ t1.join(); t2.join();
}
 catch (InterruptedException e) 
{ e.printStackTrace(); }

Properties createPropsWithDefault(Properties p) 
{
  // return new Properties(p); // OK 
  return new FormatPreservingProperties(p); // leads to deadlock
}


If createPropsWithDefault() returns Properties, everything is OK (as it should be, because Properties is thread-safe). However, if it returns FormatPreservingProperties, we occasionally get a deadlock.

Are you aware of this inconsistency? It seems that the safest way of extending Properties is to make methods that override synchronized methods synchronized.
