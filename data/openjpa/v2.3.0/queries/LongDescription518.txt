So when I deploy my war file on the application server the first time, everything works fine.  However, if I then try to undeploy or redeploy over the existing version the deployment will fail because the openjpa.jar in the WEB-INF/lib directory of my war file is locked.

I did track down the bug to:
    org.apache.openjpa.lib.util.Services


The addResources method is opening a URL Connection and not performing a setUseCaches(false).  I made the following changes, implemented the new jar in my webapp and it fixed the problem. 

    private static void addResources(URL url, Set set) throws IOException {
        InputStream in = null;
        BufferedReader reader = null;

        try {
            java.net.URLConnection ucon = url.openConnection();
            ucon.setUseCaches(false);
            in = ucon.getInputStream();
            reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(in));
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                if (line.trim().startsWith("#")


 line.trim().length() == 0)
                    continue;




                StringTokenizer tok = new StringTokenizer(line, "# \t");
                if (tok.hasMoreTokens()) {
                    String next = tok.nextToken();
                    if (next != null) 
{
                        next = next.trim();
                        if (next.length() > 0 && !next.startsWith("#"))
                            set.add(next);
                    }
                }
            }
        } 
        catch (Exception e) 
{
            throw new IOException(e.toString());
        }
        finally {
            try 
{ reader.close(); }
 catch (IOException re) {}
            try 
{ in.close(); }
 catch (IOException ioe) {}
        }
    }

Only the setUseCaches(false) should be necessary, but I was just making sure that anything that was opened was closed.

Thanks,
