With this entity:

An entity has a version field, with AUTO strategy.

@Entity
public class Department 
{
    @Id 
    private int id;
    
    @Version
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
    private int myVersion;
    
    private String name;
}

A record is inserted... 

		Department d = new Department();
		d.setName("SALES");
		em.getTransaction().begin();
		em.persist(d);
		em.getTransaction().commit();
		em.close();

...and queried. 

If the select is over the entity, "SELECT d from Department d", the version field is set up  correctly in the returned entity.

But if the version field is explicitly projected, "SELECT d.id, d.myVersion, d.name from Department d", the id and the name values are returned fine, but the myVersion value is null.
