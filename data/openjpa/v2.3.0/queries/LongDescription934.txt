There is a small oversight in TestSequenceGenerator which results in the test being run on a database without sequences and not being run on a database with sequences.

The snippet:

        try 
{
            enabled =
                ((JDBCConfiguration) emf.getConfiguration())
                    .getDBDictionaryInstance().nextSequenceQuery == null;
        }
 catch (Throwable t) 
{
            enabled = false;
        }

should read:

        try {
            enabled =
                ((JDBCConfiguration) emf.getConfiguration())
                    .getDBDictionaryInstance().nextSequenceQuery != null;
        } catch (Throwable t) {
            enabled = false;
        }
