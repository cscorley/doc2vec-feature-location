Currently users can set the job name through Pig Latin by saying

set job.name 'my job name'

The ability to set the priority would also be nice, and the patch should be small.  The goal is to be able to say

set job.priority 'high'

and throw a JobCreationException in the JobControlCompiler if the priority is not one of the allowed string values from the o.a.h.mapred.JobPriority enum: very_low, low, normal, high, very_high.   Case insensitivity makes this a little nicer.
