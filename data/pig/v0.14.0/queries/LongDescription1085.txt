Users have long asked for a way to get the JobConf structure in their UDFs.  It would also be nice to have a way to pass properties between the front end and back end so that UDFs can store state during parse time and use it at runtime.

This patch does part of what is proposed in PIG-602, but not all of it.  It does not provide a way to give user specified configuration files to UDFs.  So I will mark 602 as depending on this bug, but it isn't a duplicate.
