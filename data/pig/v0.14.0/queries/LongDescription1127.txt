Currently some logical operator only contains a schema reference to the predecessor's schema object. These logical operators include: LOSplitOutput, LOLimit, LOSplit, LOFilter, LOSort, LODistinct, LOUnion. It is ok in the before because we do not change schema object once it is set. Now with the column pruner (PIG-922), we need to change individual schema object so it is no longer acceptable. For example, the following script fail:



a = load '1.txt' as (a0, a1:map[], a2);
b = foreach a generate a1;
c = limit b 10;
dump c;



We need to fix it.
