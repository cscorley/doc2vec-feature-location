This happens when we do a union on two relations, if one column comes from a loader, the other matching column comes from a constant, and this column get pruned. We prune for the one from loader and did not prune the constant. Thus leaves union an inconsistent state. Here is a script:



a = load '1.txt' as (a0, a1:chararray, a2);
b = load '2.txt' as (b0, b2);
c = foreach b generate b0, 'hello', b2;
d = union a, c;
e = foreach d generate $0, $2;
dump e;



1.txt: 


ulysses thompson        64      1.90
katie carson    25      3.65



2.txt:


luke king       0.73
holly davidson  2.43



expected output:
(ulysses thompson,1.90)
(katie carson,3.65)
(luke king,0.73)
(holly davidson,2.43)

real output:
(ulysses thompson,)
(katie carson,)
(luke king,0.73)
(holly davidson,2.43)
