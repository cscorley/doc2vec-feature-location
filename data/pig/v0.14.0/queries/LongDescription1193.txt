Secondary sort doing nested desc sort order incorrectly if the following conditions meet:

1. We have sort and UDF in nested plan
2. This UDF will use the same input tuples more than once
3. The input tuples are sorted in desc order

Here is a test case:


register sequence.jar;
A = load 'input' as (a0:int);
B = group A ALL;
C = foreach B {
    D = order A by a0 desc;
    generate sequence.CUMULATIVE(D,D);
};
dump C;



input file:


3
4



The input for the UDF is:


({(4),(3)},{(3),(4)})



The first bag is sorted desc, but the second is not.
