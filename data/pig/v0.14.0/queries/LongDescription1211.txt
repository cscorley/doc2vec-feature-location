I have a Pig script which is structured in the following way



register cp.jar

dataset = load '/data/dataset/' using PigStorage('\u0001') as (col1, col2, col3, col4, col5);

filtered_dataset = filter dataset by (col1 == 1);

proj_filtered_dataset = foreach filtered_dataset generate col2, col3;

rmf $output1;

store proj_filtered_dataset into '$output1' using PigStorage();

second_stream = foreach filtered_dataset  generate col2, col4, col5;

group_second_stream = group second_stream by col4;

output2 = foreach group_second_stream {
 a =  second_stream.col2
 b =   distinct second_stream.col5;
 c = order b by $0;
 generate 1 as key, group as keyword, MYUDF(c, 100) as finalcalc;
}

rmf  $output2;

--syntax error here
store output2 to '$output2' using PigStorage();




I run this script using the Multi-query option, it runs successfully till the first store but later fails with a syntax error. 

The usage of HDFS option, "rmf" causes the first store to execute. 

The only option the I have is to run an explain before running his script 

grunt> explain -script myscript.pig -out explain.out

or moving the rmf statements to the top of the script

Here are some questions:

a) Can we have an option to do something like "checkscript" instead of explain to get the same syntax error?  In this way I can ensure that I do not run for 3-4 hours before encountering a syntax error
b) Can pig not figure out a way to re-order the rmf statements since all the store directories are variables

Thanks
