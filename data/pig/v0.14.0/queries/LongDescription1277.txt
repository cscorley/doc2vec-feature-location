When we cogroup on a tuple, if the inner type of tuple does not match, we treat them as different keys. This is confusing. It is desirable to give error/warnings when it happens.

Here is one example:
UDF:


public class MapGenerate extends EvalFunc<Map> {
    @Override
    public Map exec(Tuple input) throws IOException {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        Map m = new HashMap();
        m.put("key", new Integer(input.size()));
        return m;
    }
    
    @Override
    public Schema outputSchema(Schema input) {
        return new Schema(new Schema.FieldSchema(null, DataType.MAP));
    }
}



Pig script: 


a = load '1.txt' as (a0);
b = foreach a generate a0, MapGenerate(*) as m:map[];
c = foreach b generate a0, m#'key' as key;
d = load '2.txt' as (c0, c1);
e = cogroup c by (a0, key), d by (c0, c1);
dump e;



1.txt


1



2.txt


1 1



User expected result (which is not right):


((1,1),{(1,1)},{(1,1)})



Real result:


((1,1),{(1,1)},{})
((1,1),{},{(1,1)})



We shall give user the message that we can not merge the key due to the type mismatch.
