I have the following txt files which are bzipped: \t =<TAB> 


$ bzcat A.txt.bz2 
1\ta
2\taa

$bzcat B.txt.bz2
1\tb
2\tbb

$cat *.bz2 > test/mymerge.bz2
$bzcat test/mymerge.bz2 
1\ta
2\taa
1\tb
2\tbb

$hadoop fs -put test/mymerge.bz2 /user/viraj




I now write a Pig script to print values of bz2.



A = load '/user/viraj/bzipgetmerge/mymerge.bz2' using PigStorage();
dump A;



I get the records for the first bz2 file which I concatenated.

(1,a)
(2,aa)

My M/R jobs do not fail or throw any warning about this, just that it drops records. Is there a way we can throw a warning or fail the underlying Map job, can it be done in Bzip2TextInputFormat class in Pig ?
