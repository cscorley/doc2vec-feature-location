There is a particular case where I was running with the latest trunk of Pig.



$java -cp pig.jar:/home/path/hadoop20cluster org.apache.pig.Main testcase.pig

[main] INFO  org.apache.pig.Main - Logging error messages to: /homes/viraj/pig_1263420012601.log

$ls -l pig_1263420012601.log
ls: pig_1263420012601.log: No such file or directory



The job failed and the log file did not contain anything, the only way to debug was to look into the Jobtracker logs.

Here are some reasons which would have caused this behavior:
1) The underlying filer/NFS had some issues. In that case do we not error on stdout?
2) There are some errors from the backend which are not being captured
