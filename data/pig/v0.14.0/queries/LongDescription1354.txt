The need to create wrapper UDFs for simple Java functions creates unnecessary work for Pig users, slows down the development process, and produces a lot of trivial classes. We can use Java's reflection to allow invoking a number of methods on the fly, dynamically, by creating a generic UDF to accomplish this.
