The goal is to provide a simple xUnit framework that enables our Pig scripts to be easily:

	unit tested
	regression tested
	quickly prototyped



No cluster set up is required.

For example:

TestCase


  @Test
  public void testTop3Queries() {
    String[] args = {
        "n=3",        
        };
    test = new PigTest("top_queries.pig", args);

    String[] input = {
        "yahoo\t10",
        "twitter\t7",
        "facebook\t10",
        "yahoo\t15",
        "facebook\t5",
        ....
    };

    String[] output = {
        "(yahoo,25L)",
        "(facebook,15L)",
        "(twitter,7L)",
    };

    test.assertOutput("data", input, "queries_limit", output);
  }



top_queries.pig


data =
    LOAD '$input'
    AS (query:CHARARRAY, count:INT);
     
    ... 
    
queries_sum = 
    FOREACH queries_group 
    GENERATE 
        group AS query, 
        SUM(queries.count) AS count;
        
    ...
            
queries_limit = LIMIT queries_ordered $n;

STORE queries_limit INTO '$output';



They are 3 modes:

	LOCAL (if "pigunit.exectype.local" properties is present)
	MAPREDUCE (use the cluster specified in the classpath, same as HADOOP_CONF_DIR)
	
		automatic mini cluster (is the default and the HADOOP_CONF_DIR to have in the class path will be: ~/pigtest/conf)
		pointing to an existing cluster (if "pigunit.exectype.cluster" properties is present)
	
	



For now, it would be nice to see how this idea could be integrated in Piggybank and if PigParser/PigServer could improve their interfaces in order to make PigUnit simple.

Other components based on PigUnit could be built later:

	standalone MiniCluster
	notion of workspaces for each test
	standalone utility that reads test configuration and generates a test report...



It is a first prototype, open to suggestions and can definitely take advantage of feedbacks.

How to test, in pig_trunk:


Apply patch
$pig_trunk ant compile-test
$pig_trunk ant
$pig_trunk/contrib/piggybank/java ant test -Dtest.timeout=999999



(it takes 15 min in MAPREDUCE minicluster, tests will need to be split in the future between 'unit' and 'integration')

Many examples are in:


contrib/piggybank/java/src/test/java/org/apache/pig/piggybank/test/pigunit/TestPigTest.java



When used as a standalone, do not forget commons-lang-2.4.jar and the HADOOP_CONF_DIR to your cluster in your CLASSPATH.
