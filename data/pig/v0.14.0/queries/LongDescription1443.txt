Currently, in DefaultTuple, we estimate the memory footprint for string as if it is char array. The formula we use is:  length * 2 + 12. It turns out we underestimate the memory usage for string. Here is a list of real memory footprint for string we get from memory dump:



 length of string 
 memory in bytes 


 7 
 56 


 3 
 48 


 1 
 40 




I did a search and find the following formula can accurately estimate the memory footprint for string:


8 * (int) (((length * 2) + 45) / 8)
