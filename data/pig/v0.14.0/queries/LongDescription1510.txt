It would be useful to have a way to `deepCopy` an expression. `deepCopy` will create a new object so that changes made to one object will not reflect in the copy. There are 2 reasons why we don't override clone.

	It may be better to use `deepCopy` since the copy semantics are explicit (since deepCopy may be expensive).
	A second important reason for defining `deepCopy` as a separate routine is that it can be passed a plan as an argument which will be updated as the expression is copied (through plan.add and plan.connect).



The usage would look like the following:

LogicalExpressionPlan logicalPlan = new LogicalExpressionPlan();
LogicalExpression copyExpression = origExpression.deepCopy( logicalPlan );



An immediate motivation for this would be for constructing the expressions that constitute the CNF form of an expression.
