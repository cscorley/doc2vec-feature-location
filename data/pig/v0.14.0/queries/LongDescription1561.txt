I have a simple Pig script which uses the XMLLoader after the Piggybank is built.



register piggybank.jar;
A = load '/user/viraj/capacity-scheduler.xml.gz' using org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.XMLLoader('property') as (docs:chararray);
B = limit A 1;
dump B;
--store B into '/user/viraj/handlegz' using PigStorage();




returns empty tuple


()



If you supply the uncompressed XML file, you get


(<property>
    <name>mapred.capacity-scheduler.queue.my.capacity</name>
    <value>10</value>
    <description>Percentage of the number of slots in the cluster that are
      guaranteed to be available for jobs in this queue.
    </description>    
  </property>)
