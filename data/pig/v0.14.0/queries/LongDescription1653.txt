The following script fail:


register '/homes/jianyong/pig/aaa/scriptingudf.py' using jython as myfuncs;
a = load '/user/pig/tests/data/singlefile/studenttab10k' using PigStorage() as (name, age, gpa:double);
b = foreach a generate myfuncs.square(gpa);
dump b;



If we change the register to use relative path (such as "aaa/scriptingudf.py"), it success.
