The following script produce wrong result:


A = load '1.txt' AS (a0:int, a1:int);
B = load '2.txt' AS (b0:int, b1:chararray);
C = join A by a0, B by b0;
D = foreach B generate b0 as d0, b1 as d1;
E = join C by a1, D by d0;
F = foreach E generate b1, d1;
dump F;



1.txt:
1       2
1       3
2       4
2       5

2.txt:
1       one
2       two

Expected:
(one,two)

We get:
(one,one)
