When special chars #, @ , and the 'optional' patterns described here - http://www.brics.dk/automaton/doc/dk/brics/automaton/RegExp.html#RegExp%28java.lang.String%29 are used , the regex match fails to work. 

This is related to  PIG-965.

Example and workaround are as follows -



grunt> cat t.txt                           
asd#asdf
zxcasdf
2#asdf

grunt> l = load 't.txt' as (a : chararray);
grunt> f = filter l by (a matches '.*#.*');
grunt> dump f; 
-- No output, though two rows are expected.

--As a workaround, add a \ to escape the # . This regex is valid even in 0.7 , and it will be even after this bug is fixed (its valid java regex, which has same meaning as above regex).
grunt> f = filter l by (a matches '.*\\#.*');
grunt> dump f; 
asd#asdf
2#asdf
