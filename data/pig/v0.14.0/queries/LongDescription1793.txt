As production Pig scripts grow longer and longer, Pig Latin has a need to integrate standard programming techniques of separation and code sharing offered by functions and modules.  A proposal of adding macro expansion to Pig Latin is posted here: http://wiki.apache.org/pig/TuringCompletePig

Below is a brief summary of the proposed syntax (and examples):


	Macro Definition



The existing DEFINE keyword will be expanded to allow definitions of Pig macros. 

Syntax



define <name> (<params>) returns <aliases> {
    <Pig Latin fragment>
};



Example



define my_macro(A, sortkey) returns C {
    B = filter $A by my_filter(*);
    $C = order B by $sortkey;
}




	Macro Expansion



Syntax



<aliases> = <macro name> (<params>);



Example: Use above macro in a Pig script:



X = load 'foo' as (user, address, phone);
Y = my_macro(X, user);
store Y into 'bar';



This script is expanded into the following Pig Latin statements: 



X = load 'foo' as (user, address, phone);
macro_my_macro_B_1 = filter X by my_filter(*);
Y = order macro_my_macro_B_1 by user;
store Y into 'bar';



Notes

1. Any alias in the macro which isn't visible from outside will be prefixed with macro name and suffixed with instance id to avoid namespace collision. 
2. Macro expansion is not a complete replacement for function calls. Recursive expansions are not supported.  


	Macro Import



The new IMPORT keyword can be used to add macros defined in another Pig Latin file.

Syntax



import <Pig Latin file name>;



Example



import my_macro.pig;



Note: All macro names are in the global namespace.
