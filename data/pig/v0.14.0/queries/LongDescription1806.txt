public BoundScript bind(Map<String, Object> vars) throws IOException {...}

	fs method. Current Pig.fs(...) method doesn't return any value. Since this method just turns around to call FsShell.run() which has a return code, we should pass this return code to the user;





public static int fs(String cmd) throws IOException {...}
