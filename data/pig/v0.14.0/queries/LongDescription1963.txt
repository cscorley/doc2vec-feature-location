This happens only when secondary sort is not being used for the order-by. 
For example -


a1 = load 'fruits.txt' as (f1:int,f2);
a2 = load 'fruits.txt' as (f1:int,f2);

b = cogroup a1 by f1, a2 by f1;

d = foreach b {
   sort1 = order a1 by f2;
   sort2 = order a2 by f2; -- secondary sort not getting used here, MYCONCATBAG gets results in wrong order
   generate group, MYCONCATBAG(sort1.f1), MYCONCATBAG(sort2.f2);
}

-- explain d;
dump d;
