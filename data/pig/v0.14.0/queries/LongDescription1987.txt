The following script works



set default_parallel 10;
import 'scripts/macro1.pig';
import 'scripts/macro2.pig';

wlogs = load 'clicks' as (url, pageid, timestamp);
good  = spam_filter(wlogs, url);



But if -dryrun is added to the command line it returns the error:



ERROR 1200: <file scripts/book.pig.substituted, line 1, column 0>  Syntax error, unexpected symbol at or near 'set'
