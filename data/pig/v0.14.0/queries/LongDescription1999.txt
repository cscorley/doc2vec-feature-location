Macro alias masker doesn't consider the current schema context. This results errors when deciding with alias to mask. Here is an example:



define toBytearray(in, intermediate) returns e { 
   a = load '$in' as (name:chararray, age:long, gpa: float);
   b = group a by  name;
   c = foreach b generate a, (1,2,3);
   store c into '$intermediate' using BinStorage();
   d = load '$intermediate' using BinStorage() as (b:bag{t:tuple(x,y,z)}, t2:tuple(a,b,c));
   $e = foreach d generate COUNT(b), t2.a, t2.b, t2.c;
};
 
f = toBytearray ('data', 'output1');

 

Now the alias masker mistakes b in COUNT(b) as an alias instead of b in the current schema.

The workaround is to not use alias as as names in the schema definition.
