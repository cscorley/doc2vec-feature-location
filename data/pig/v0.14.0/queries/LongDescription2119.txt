The input:


grunt> cat b.txt
a       11
b       3
c       10
a       12
b       10
c       15



The script:


a = load 'b.txt' AS (id:chararray, num:int);
b = group a by id;
c = foreach b { 
  d = order a by num DESC;
  n = COUNT(a);
  e = limit d 1;
  generate n;
}



The exception:


Caused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.pig.newplan.logical.relational.LOLimit cannot be cast to org.apache.pig.newplan.logical.relational.LOGenerate
        at org.apache.pig.newplan.logical.rules.DuplicateForEachColumnRewrite$DuplicateForEachColumnRewriteTransformer.check(DuplicateForEachColumnRewrite.java:87)
        at org.apache.pig.newplan.optimizer.PlanOptimizer.optimize(PlanOptimizer.java:108)




I know the script is a bit pointless, but I was just testing and modifying the script bit by bit.
If I remove the limit in any case I get the same exception but with LOSort.

The problem, I think, is that the rule assumes there is only 1 sink in the nested block and that this sink is a LOGenerate.
