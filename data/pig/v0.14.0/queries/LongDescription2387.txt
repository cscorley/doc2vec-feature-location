Hi,

When an input file of size greater than default split size is loaded using BinStorage() and some processing is done, the task returns negative progress

Script



A = load 'input' using BinStorage() as (a:chararray);
B = filter A by (a matches '.*blinds.*');
store B into 'op';




Looking at the code, BinStorage which uses BinStorageRecordReader, has getProgress()



public float getProgress() {
    if (start == end) {
      return 0.0f;
    } else {
          return Math.min(1.0f, (pos - start) / (float)(end - start));
    }
  }



In BinStorageRecordReader, pos is always 0 and not getting updated at any point.
So when the input file of size greater than default split size is loaded and processed, the getProgress() method returns negative value, thus showing negative progress.
