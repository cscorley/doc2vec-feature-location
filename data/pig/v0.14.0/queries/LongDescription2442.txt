Hi,

If there are multiple store in a pig streaming script, it goes into infinite waiting. 

Script


DEFINE SCRIPT `./a.pl` SHIP ('/homes/anithar/a.pl');;
DEFINE SCRIPT1 `./b.pl` SHIP ('/homes/anithar/b.pl');;
A = LOAD 'test.txt' USING PigStorage() ;
B1 = STREAM A THROUGH SCRIPT ;
B1 = foreach B1 generate $0;
STORE B1 INTO 'B1' USING PigStorage();
B2 =  STREAM B1 THROUGH SCRIPT1;
STORE B2 INTO 'B2' USING PigStorage();



a.pl
--------
#! /usr/bin/perl -w
while (my $line = <STDIN>) 
{
        print uc($line);
}
--------

b.pl
---------
#! /usr/bin/perl -w
while (my $line = <STDIN>) 
{
        print $line;
}
---------

Input (test.txt)


test
hi
hello



This infinite waiting happens randomly causing the job to fail with "Task attempt failed to report
status for 605 seconds. Killing!". 
Same happens with 0.8 version too.
