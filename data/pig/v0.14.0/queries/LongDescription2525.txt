It would be convenient to be able to implement PigProcessNotifcationListener and to wire it into a pig script. This jira is to support setting a listener and its constructor args on the command, perhaps like this:

noformat
pig -j MyListener -J "foo,bar,bat" -f my_script.pig
noformat

where MyListener takes a single string in the constructor which will get passed foo,bar,bat.
