If I have an embedded pig script in python, there is no way to get user passed parameters in the python script.
Though PIG-2165 adds the capability of reading these params in the pig script, from python it is still not possible.
It would be nice to have this feature if I have some sort of post processing happening in my python scrip based on the params.
