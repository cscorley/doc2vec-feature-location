PIG-2334 was helpful in understanding this issue. Short version is input file size is only computed if the path begins with a whitelisted prefix, currently:


	/
	hdfs:
	file:
	s3n:



As HCatalog locations use the form dbname.tablename the input file size is not computed, and the size-based parallelism optimization breaks.

DETAILS:

I discovered this issue comparing two runs on the same script, one loading regular HDFS paths, and one with HCatalog db.table names. I just happened to notice the "Setting number of reducers" line difference.

Loading HDFS files reducers is set to 99

2012-03-08 01:33:56,522 [main] INFO  org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.JobControlCompiler - BytesPerReducer=1000000000 maxReducers=999 totalInputFileSize=98406674162

Loading with an HCatalog db.table name

2012-03-08 01:06:02,283 [main] INFO  org.apache.pig.backend.hadoop.executionengine.mapReduceLayer.JobControlCompiler - BytesPerReducer=1000000000 maxReducers=999 totalInputFileSize=0

Possible fix: Pig should just ask the loader for the size of its inputs rather than special-casing certain location types.
