Currently no build info is printed when running pig, so its not clear specifically what version you are running. For users, they do not know if the version was updated, which might explain a change in behavior. For developers, its not clear if you're actually running the development jar you're testing.

This could be improved by printing a line at startup saying what version of pig you are using.

PROPOSED BUILD MESSAGE:

Note "exported" below happens because I built from a git repo, per the svnversion command.
