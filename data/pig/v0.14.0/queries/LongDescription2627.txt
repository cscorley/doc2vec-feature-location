A = load 'i3.txt' as (k,v);
L = FILTER A BY k == 'k1';
B = GROUP A BY k PARTITION BY SimpleCustomPartitioner PARALLEL 3;
C = FOREACH B GENERATE FLATTEN(A) PARALLEL 3;
STORE C INTO 'output1';
STORE L INTO 'output2';



For the above script the custom partitioner mentioned in the GROUP BY statement is ignored by Pig.
To workaround this issue I had to disable Multiquery or put exec statements in between.

The configuration is getting missed out while the Physical plan is getting converted into the MR plan.
(Note the POGlobalRearrange is visited on a different MROper than what the actual MRPlan returns)
