The goal is to provide better information about what is actually running in a job.
In particular when alias names are being reused.

For example with the following script:


A = LOAD 'foo' using PigStorage();
B = GROUP A BY $0;
A = FOREACH B GENERATE COUNT(A);
STORE A INTO 'bar';



The job conf will contain the following information


pig.alias.location: M: A[1,4],A[3,4],B[2,4] C: A[3,4],B[2,4] R: A[3,4]



A caveat is that the Logical Plan Optimizer throws away the original information when merging Logical Operators.
this is already the case today with pig.alias
