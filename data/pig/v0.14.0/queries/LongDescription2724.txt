Seriously, is there a more annoying pattern than the following?


for (int i = 0; i < t.size(); i++) {
    try {
        doStuff(t.get(i));
    } catch (ExecException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException("BUT I THOUGHT PIG WAS SINGLETHREADED", e);
    }
}



I mean yeah, you can do the following:



for (Object o : t.getAll()) {
    doStuff(o);
}



But I don't even think that should be necessary. I think the following should work:



for (Object o : t) {
    doStuff(o);
}



It's a shame we can't give a default implementation (I either shake my fist that this won't be possible until Java 8 OR that Tuple is an interface and not an abstract class). Either way, I even added test! WOAH.

Thoughts?
