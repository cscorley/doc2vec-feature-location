The class org.apache.pig.pigunit.pig.PigServer does not set the default log level of its instance of PigContext so that pigunit tests that have 



set debug off;



in them, will cause a NullPointerException at org.apache.pig.PigServer line 291 because the default log level is not set.

So I think org.apache.pig.pigunit.pig.PigServer should do something like 



pigContext.setDefaultLogLevel(Level.INFO);



in its contructors.
