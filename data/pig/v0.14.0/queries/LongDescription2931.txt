To reproduce the issue, use the following pig script:
test.pig

a = load 'data';
b = filter by $FILTER;



and run the following command:


pig -x local -dryrun -f test.pig -p FILTER="(\$0 == 'a')"



This generates the following script:
test.pig.substituted

a = load 'data';
b = filter by ($FILTER == 'a');



However this should be:


a = load 'data';
b = filter by ($0 == 'a');



This is because Pig calls replaceFirst() with a replacement string that include a $ sign as follows:


"$FILTER".replaceFirst("\\$FILTER", "($0 == 'a')"));



To treat $ signs as literals in the replacement string, we must escape them. Please see the Java doc for Matcher class for explanation:

Note that backslashes () and dollar signs ($) in the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement string.
