I've attached a patch that makes AvroStorage accept a "schema_uri" flag when storing an alias. The schema used to store the contents of the alias is the contents of the file the URI refers to (which must exist). This fits somewhere between the "schema" flag - specifying the schema as an inline string - and the "same" flag - specifying the schema as it appears in a data file.
