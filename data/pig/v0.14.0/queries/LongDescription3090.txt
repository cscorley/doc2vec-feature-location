Sometimes I feel like swimming with ANTLRs. This particular feature isn't too hard to add... and supports syntax like this:



a = load 'thing' as (x:int);
b = foreach @ generate x;
c = foreach @ generate x;
d = foreach @ generate x;



I have a patch, though I need to make sure it doesn't change anything (it shouldn't) and I need to add tests.
