PIG-2994 made explain with no alias be equivalent to explain on the previous alias. This breaks TestMultiQueryBasic.testMultiQueryWithSplitInMapAndMultiMerge because the previous alias is an auto-generated alias not a user-defined alias.

The following fixes the test:


         "I = GROUP F2 BY (f7, f8);" +
         "STORE I into 'foo4'  using BinStorage();" +
-        "explain;";
+        "explain I;";
