Hi.
Looks like PIG-3020
but works in a different way.
Our pig version is: 
Apache Pig version 0.10.0-cdh4.2.0 (rexported) 
compiled Feb 15 2013, 12:20:54

Accoring to release note, PIG-3020 is included into CDH 4.2 dist
http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh4/cdh/4/pig-0.10.0-cdh4.2.0.CHANGES.txt

The problem:
We want to do self join to get cross-product


a = load '/input' as (key, x);

a_group = group a by key;
b = foreach a_group {
  y = a.x;
  pair = cross a.x, y;
  generate flatten(pair);
}

dump b;



And an error:


ERROR org.apache.pig.tools.grunt.Grunt - ERROR 2270: Logical plan invalid state: duplicate uid in schema : 1-7::x#16:bytearray,y::x#16:bytearray



Here is workaround 


a = load '/input' as (key, x:int);

a_group = group a by key;
b = foreach a_group {
  y = foreach a generate -(-x);
  pair = cross a.x, y;
  generate flatten(pair);
}

dump b;
