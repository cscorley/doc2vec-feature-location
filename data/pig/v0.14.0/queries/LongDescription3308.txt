I've coded HiveColumnarStorage that can store Pig structures as a Hive Columnar RC tables. Code is based on Elephant-bird RCFilePigStorage. The difference is that data are stored in Hive friendly format, so file can be read from Hive. 

Example Pig schema:


f1:tuple (f11: chararray,f12: chararray),f2:map[]



Hive schema:


CREATE TABLE sample_table (f1 struct<f11:string,f12:string>, f2 array<struct<f21:string,f22:string>>)
PARTITIONED BY (p string) 
STORED AS RCFILE 



or as a:


CREATE TABLE sample_table (f1 struct<f11:string,f12:string>, f2 MAP <string,string>)
PARTITIONED BY (p string) 
STORED AS RCFILE
