Currently CASE expression builds nested BinCond expressions in the following order: from top to bottom when branches => from in to out bin conds.

This can be confusing if non-mutually exclusive conditions are used in when branches. For example,


CASE 
    WHEN x > 100 THEN 'a'
    WHEN x > 50  THEN 'b'
    ELSE 'c'
END


is converted to


x > 50 ? 'b' : ( x > 100 ? 'a' : 'c' )


Now if x is 1000, the result is 'b', which is not quite expected.

Instead, we should construct nested BinCond expressions in the same order as that of when branches, i.e.


x > 100 ? 'a' : ( x > 50 ? 'b' : 'c' )
