The "job.name" property can be used to overwrite the default job name in Pig, but the dump command does not honor it.

To reproduce the issue, run the following commands in Grunt shell in MR mode:


SET job.name 'FOO';
a = LOAD '/foo';
DUMP a;


You will see the job name is not 'FOO' in the JT UI. However, using store instead of dump sets the job name correctly.
