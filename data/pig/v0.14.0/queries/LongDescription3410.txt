Consider following script-


hcat_load = LOAD 'X' using org.apache.hcatalog.pig.HCatLoader();
hcat_filter = FILTER hcat_load BY (part='Y');
hcat_limited = limit hcat_filter 5;
dump hcat_limited;                     


This script is not benefited from LimitOptimizer (pushing limit to loadfunc) because LimitOptimizer is applied before PartitionFilterOptimizer.
