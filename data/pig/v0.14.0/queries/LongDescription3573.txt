Accumulo has some code to allow reading and writing from it through Pig. I've been working on making it more robust and would like to try to get it included into Pig (to avoid the necessity to bundle additional jars).

Some info on what currently exists http://people.apache.org/~elserj/accumulo-pig/, and the current code https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=accumulo-pig.git

1. Need to translate Maven build into Ant+Ivy
2. Need to figure out how to support Accumulo 1.4 and 1.5 builds (differences in dependencies and APIs)
