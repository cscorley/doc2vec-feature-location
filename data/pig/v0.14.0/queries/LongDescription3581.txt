Consider the following script:


A = LOAD 'test_data' AS (a: int, b: int);
C = FOREACH A GENERATE *;
B = FOREACH (GROUP A BY a) {
	C = FILTER A BY b % 2 == 0;
	D = FILTER A BY b % 2 == 1;
	GENERATE group AS a, A.b AS every, C.b AS even, D.b AS odd;
};
DESCRIBE B;


Notice that C is defined both inside the nested foreach as well as outside. I would expect that in the GENERATE inside the nested FOREACH, the C that is used will be the one that is defined inside. If that is not so, I think at least a warning is due.

However, currently Pig silently assumes that the C you mean one is the one that is defined outside the nested FOREACH.

Hence, the result of "DESCRIBE B" looks as follows:


B: {
    a: int,
    every: {
        (
            b: int
        )
    },
    even: int,
    odd: {
        (
            b: int
        )
    }
}



If I remove the definition of C that is outside the foreach, then I get the following for "DESCRIBE B":


B: {
    a: int,
    every: {
        (
            b: int
        )
    },
    even: {
        (
            b: int
        )
    },
    odd: {
        (
            b: int
        )
    }
}
