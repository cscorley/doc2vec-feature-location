The too-often used trick of rounding to a fixed number of decimal places by writing '1000 * Math.round(num / 1000.0)' is not only unsightly, it's numerically imprecise (http://stackoverflow.com/a/12684082/41857). The attached patch adds a function to do this.

ROUND_TO(val, digits) accepts a single float or double value, along with an integer number of digits, and returns the value to that number of decimal places 

Examples:  



ROUND_TO(3.14159f, 3) -- returns a float 3.142
ROUND_TO(3.14159d, 0) -- returns a double 3.0.



I also added unit tests for ROUND – there were none before that I could find.

I don't know how to write a unit test that the schema correctly routes to FloatRoundTo and DoubleRoundTo – if the ones I provided are insufficient please point me to a simple example to emulate.
