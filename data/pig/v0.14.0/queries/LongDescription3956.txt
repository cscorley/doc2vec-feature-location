Pig provides UDF profiling via the pig.udf.profile perperty. How it works is that it samples every 100th UDF invocation and increments a counter by 100 x elapsed time.


private final static int TIMING_FREQ = 100;
...
PigStatusReporter.getInstance().incrCounter(counterGroup, TIMING_COUNTER,
    Math.round((System.nanoTime() - startNanos) / 1000) * TIMING_FREQ);


The problem is that this assumes every invocation takes about the same time, which doesn't hold true oftentimes.

Here is an example. TIMING_FREQ = 100.


set pig.udf.profile true;
set opt.fetch false;
l = LOAD 'foo' AS (value:chararray);
f = FOREACH l GENERATE LOWER(value);
DUMP f;



This job gives me the following counters-


org.apache.pig.builtin.LOWER - approx_invocations: 6,144,600
org.apache.pig.builtin.LOWER - approx_microsecs: 130,913,800



However, if I change TIMING_FREQ to 1, I get the followings-


org.apache.pig.builtin.LOWER - approx_invocations: 6,144,248
org.apache.pig.builtin.LOWER - approx_microsecs: 19,711,842



As can be seen, approx_microsecs is 6x larger when sampling every 100th invocation as compared to when sampling every invocation.
