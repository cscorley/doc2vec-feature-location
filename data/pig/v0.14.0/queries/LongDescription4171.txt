To reproduce the error, register any udf as streaming_python and run it in direct fetch mode.

It fails with the following error in my environment-


    sys.argv[5], sys.argv[6], sys.argv[7], sys.argv[8])
  File "/mnt/pig_tmp/prodpig/controller4894777320356829424.py", line 77, in main
    self.output_stream = open(output_stream_path, 'a')
IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/mnt/var/lib/hadoop/tmp/udfOutput/sanitize.out'


The problem is that Streaming UDF tries to write out a log, but the user doesn't have write permission to the default location (hadoop.tmp.dir).

In fact, Streaming UDF handles local mode properly by using pig.udf.scripting.log.dir instead of hadoop.log.dir or hadoop.tmp.dir. We should do the same for direct fetch mode.
