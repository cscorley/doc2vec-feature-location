Here is a repo script (using PigPen )-


REGISTER pigpen.jar;

load4254 = LOAD 'input.clj'
    USING PigStorage('\n')
    AS (value:chararray);

DEFINE udf4265 pigpen.PigPenFnDataBag('(clojure.core/require (quote [pigpen.runtime]) (quote [clojure.edn]))','(pigpen.runtime/exec [(pigpen.runtime/process->bind (pigpen.runtime/pre-process :pig :native)) (pigpen.runtime/map->bind clojure.edn/read-string) (pigpen.runtime/key-selector->bind clojure.core/identity) (pigpen.runtime/process->bind (pigpen.runtime/post-process :pig :native-key-frozen-val))])');

generate4263 = FOREACH load4254 GENERATE
    FLATTEN(udf4265(value));
generate4257 = FOREACH generate4263 GENERATE
    $0 AS key,
    $1 AS value;

order4258 = ORDER generate4257 BY key DESC; <-- sort order isn't changed by DESC
dump order4258;


This script returns the same result for both ASC and DESC orders.

The problem is as follows-

	PigBytesRawComparator calls BinInterSedesTupleRawComparator.compare().
	BinInterSedesTupleRawComparator applies descending order.
	PigBytesRawComparator applies descending order again to what BinInterSedesTupleRawComparator returns.



Therefore, descending order is never applied.
