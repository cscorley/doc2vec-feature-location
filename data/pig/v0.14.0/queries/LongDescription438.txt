We do not handle re-aliasing of an existing alias - this should be handled correctly.

The following script should work:



a = load 'studenttab10k';
b = filter a by $1 > '25';
c = b;

-- use b
d = cogroup b by $0, a by $0;
e = foreach d generate flatten(b), flatten(a);
dump e

-- use c
f = cogroup c by $0, a by $0;
g = foreach f generate flatten(c), flatten(a);
dump g;
