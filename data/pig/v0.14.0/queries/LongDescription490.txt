Given a query like:



A = load 'myfile';
B = group A by ($0, $1);
C = foreach B generate group.$0, group.$1, COUNT(A);



The combiner will not be invoked.  But if the last line is changed to:



C = foreach B generate flatten(group), COUNT(A);



it will be.  The reason for the discrepancy is because the CombinerOptimizer checks that all of the projections are simple.  If not, it does not use the combiner.  group.$0 is not a simple projection, so this is failed.  However, this is a common enough case that the CombinerOptimizer should detect it and still use the combiner.
