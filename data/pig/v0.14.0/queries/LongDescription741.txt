I'd like to compute the top 10 results in each group.

The natural way to express this in Pig would be:



A = load '...' using PigStorage() as (
    date: int,
    count: int,
    url: chararray
);

B = group A by ( date );

C = foreach B {
    D = order A by count desc;
    E = limit D 10;
    generate
        FLATTEN(E);
    };

dump C;



Yeah, I could write a UDF / PiggyBank function to take the top n results. But since LIMIT already exists as a statement, it seems like it should also work in the nested foreach context.

Example workaround code.



C = foreach B {
    D = order A by count desc;
    E = util.TOP(D, 10);
    generate
        FLATTEN(E);
    };

dump C;
