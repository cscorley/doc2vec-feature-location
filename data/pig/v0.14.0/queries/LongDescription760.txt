I'm finding PigStorage() really convenient for storage and data interchange because it compresses well and imports into Excel and other analysis environments well.

However, it is a pain when it comes to maintenance because the columns are in fixed locations and I'd like to add columns in some cases.

It would be great if load PigStorage() could read a default schema from a .schema file stored with the data and if store PigStorage() could store a .schema file with the data.

I have tested this out and both Hadoop HDFS and Pig in -exectype local mode will ignore a file called .schema in a directory of part files.

So, for example, if I have a chain of Pig scripts I execute such as:

A = load 'data-1' using PigStorage() as ( a: int , b: int );

store A into 'data-2' using PigStorage();

B = load 'data-2' using PigStorage();

describe B;

describe B should output something like 
{ a: int, b: int }
