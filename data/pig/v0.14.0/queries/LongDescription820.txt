Currently a sampling job requires that data already be stored in BinaryStorage format, since RandomSampleLoader extends BinaryStorage.  For order by this
has mostly been acceptable, because users tend to use order by at the end of their script where other MR jobs have already operated on the data and thus it
is already being stored in BinaryStorage.  For pig scripts that just did an order by, an entire MR job is required to read the data and write it out
in BinaryStorage format.

As we begin work on join algorithms that will require sampling, this requirement to read the entire input and write it back out will not be acceptable.
Join is often the first operation of a script, and thus is much more likely to trigger this useless up front translation job.

Instead RandomSampleLoader can be changed to subsume an existing loader, using the user specified loader to read the tuples while handling the skipping
between tuples itself.  This will require the subsumed loader to implement a Samplable Interface, that will look something like:



public interface SamplableLoader extends LoadFunc {
    
    /**
     * Skip ahead in the input stream.
     * @param n number of bytes to skip
     * @return number of bytes actually skipped.  The return semantics are
     * exactly the same as {@link java.io.InpuStream#skip(long)}
     */
    public long skip(long n) throws IOException;
    
    /**
     * Get the current position in the stream.
     * @return position in the stream.
     */
    public long getPosition() throws IOException;
}



The MRCompiler would then check if the loader being used to load data implemented the SamplableLoader interface.  If so, rather than create an initial MR
job to do the translation it would create the sampling job, having RandomSampleLoader use the user specified loader.
