A layer is needed to provide a high level data access abstraction and a tabular view of data in Hadoop, and could free Pig users from implementing their own data storage/retrieval code.  This layer should also include a columnar storage format in order to provide fast data projection, CPU/space-efficient data serialization, and a schema language to manage physical storage metadata.  Eventually it could also support predicate pushdown for further performance improvement.  Initially, this layer could be a contrib project in Pig and become a hadoop subproject later on.
