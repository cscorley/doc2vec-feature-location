If a filter follows a foreach that produces an added column then push up filter fails with a null pointer exception.



...
x = foreach w generate $0, COUNT($1);
y = filter x by $1 > 10;



In the above example, the column in the filter's expression is an added column. As a result, the optimizer rule is not able to map it back to the input resulting in a null value. The subsequent for loop is failing due to NPE.
