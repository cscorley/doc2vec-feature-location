Access Control: when processes try to read from the column groups, Zebra should be able to handle allowed vs. disallowed user/application accesses.  The security is eventuallt granted by corresponding  HDFS security of the data stored.

Expected behavior when column group permissions are set:

    When user selects only columns that they do not have permissions to access, Zebra should return error with message "Error #: Permission denied for accessing column <column name or names> 

Access control applies to an entire column group, so all columns in a column group have same permissions.
