In the tests code, there are lots of:

private String initString = "mapreduce";

@Test
public void testSomething() {
    ....
    PigServer pig = new PigServer(initString);
    ....
}



It could be replace with 

PigServer pig = new PigServer(ExecType.MAPREDUCE);



It would remove duplication in test.
Using a string makes the tests aware of the internal PigServer behavior.

It's really not a big deal hence the "trivial"
