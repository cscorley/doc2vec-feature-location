There some significant space for improvement in the PigCombine. 
In each reduce call some objects are deserialized from the jobConf and also the object graph is generated again and again. 
Hadoop garanties to call the configure method before a run through and things like inputCount can be than cached as fields. 
During reduce calls the jobConf will not change so re deserialization and instantiation of all this objects 

pigContext, evalPipe, inputCount, oc, finalout, esp and so on and so on, makes no sense from my point of view.

Not sure how often the PigCombine is used, but it will significant improve performance if we fix this.
Was there any reason to do things like this or is that just historical? 
As soon the test suite is running again, I would be happy to work on a patch if there is no other options about that.
