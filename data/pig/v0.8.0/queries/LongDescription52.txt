I believe the current implementation of the Local Plan Compiler does not properly support SPLIT clauses. The code seems not to properly handle instances of LOSplit logical operators.

I am opening this issue to track the problem and I am assigning it to me because, as part of the work I am doing on the abstraction layer (see PIG-32), I am currently working on the logical plan compiler.
