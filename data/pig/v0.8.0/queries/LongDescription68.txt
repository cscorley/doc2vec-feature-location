The build file can be improve in many ways:

	add revision number to pig.jar name (like: pig-r1234.jar)
	put pig.jar in the dist dir
	"clean" target leave a "depend" folder undeleted
	use a regexp to delete files in "org\apache\pig\impl\logicalLayer\parser" folder instead of listing all files one by one that you want to delete
	put all artifacts (classes, jar, etc...) in the dist folder so that when doing clean you just need to specify dist
	provide a description for targets (for "ant -projecthelp" command)
	use spaces or tabs but not both (spaces are better for patch and diff in my opinion)
