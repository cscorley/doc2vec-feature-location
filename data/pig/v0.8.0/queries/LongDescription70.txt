Even if the PigContext code is still quite small at the moment, for an outsider (me) it's already hard to understand 

If I understand correctly the PigContext purpose (on a Object Oriented point of view) is to hold various configuration objects like JobConf, JobClient, JobSubmissionProtocol...
The initialization code mainly use the ExecType parameter but can also use quite complex code like: doHod(), initProperties(), connect()...
(btw, the connect() method is actually doing 2 things: initializing some var and trying to connect, it initialization code should be move somewhere else)

It is the perfect case to apply the Factory Pattern , you can also see Replace Constructor with Factory Method for more details.

My proposal is to create a new PigContextFactory class, to old the initialization code make to PigContext and PigContextFactory 200 lines classes instead of one big 500 lines of code class.
PigContext would hold some getter and setter and methods related to instantiate/run "functions"

The new API would be:
PigContextFactory .java

public class PigContextFactory {
    public static PigContext getInstance(ExecType execType) {...}
}



PigContext.java

public class PigContext implements Serializable, FunctionInstantiator {
    public String getJobName(){...}
    public JobSubmissionProtocol getJobTracker() {...}
    public JobConf getConf() {...}
    public static Object instantiateFuncFromSpec(String funcSpec) throws IOException{...}
    public Object instantiateFuncFromAlias(String alias) throws IOException {...}
    public void registerFunction(String function, String functionSpec) {...}
}



Client code

PigContext context = PigContextFactory.getInstance(ExecType.MAPREDUCE);
