Pig is logging quite a lot into System.out or System.err. Using a embedded pig in a production environment requires a logging abstraction like log4j, commons logging, slf4j or something like that. 
I would be happy to work on a patch if we decide what would be the best choice. Hadoop uses log4j.
Thanks.
