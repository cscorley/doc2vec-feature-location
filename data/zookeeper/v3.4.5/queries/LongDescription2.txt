There are a couple of cases of member variables that need to be marked volatile or surrounded in a synchronization block. A couple of examples are:


	QuorumPeer state should be synchronous
	currentVote in QuorumPeer is marked volatile, but when it's members are often accessed individually as if they were in an atomic unit. Such code should be changed to get a reference to the currentVote and they access members through that reference.
	It looks like logicalClock in FastLeaderElection should be volatile. It should either be fixed or commented to explain why it doesn't need to be.
