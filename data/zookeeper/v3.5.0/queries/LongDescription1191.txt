In Leader.java, getEpochToPropose() and waitForEpochAck() have the following code:

if (readyToStart && verifier.containsQuorum(electingFollowers)) 
{
     electionFinished = true;
     electingFollowers.notifyAll();
}
 else {
     electingFollowers.wait(self.getInitLimit()*self.getTickTime());
     if (waitingForNewEpoch) 
{
	throw new InterruptedException("Out of time to propose an epoch");
     }
}	

In Java, the wait statement can wake up without being notified, interrupted, or timing out, a so-called spurious wakeup. So it should be guarded by a while loop with the condition we're waiting for.
