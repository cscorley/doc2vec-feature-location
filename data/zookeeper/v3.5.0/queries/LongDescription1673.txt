Currently, when i try to set ACL with cidr in expression, i get exception:



[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 2] setAcl /AS0 ip:127.0.0.1/8:cdrwa
Exception in thread "main" org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$InvalidACLException: KeeperErrorCode = InvalidACL for /AS0
	at org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException.create(KeeperException.java:112)
	at org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException.create(KeeperException.java:42)

Also, there is no support for CIDR in IPAuthenticationProvider.isValid, but IPAuthenticationProvider.matches has it.
