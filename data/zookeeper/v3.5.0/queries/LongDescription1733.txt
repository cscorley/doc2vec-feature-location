FLETest#testLE fail intermittently on windows boxes. The reason is that in LEThread#run() we have:


                                if(leader == i){
                                    synchronized(finalObj){
                                        successCount++;
                                        if(successCount > (count/2)) finalObj.notify();
                                    }

                                    break;
                                }



Basically once we have a confirmed leader, the leader thread dies due to the "break" of while loop. 

While in the verification step, we check if the leader thread alive or not as following:


       if(threads.get((int) leader).isAlive()){
           Assert.fail("Leader hasn't joined: " + leader);
       }


On windows boxes, the above verification step fails frequently because leader thread most likely already exits.

Do we know why we have the leader alive verification step only lead thread can bump up successCount >= count/2?
