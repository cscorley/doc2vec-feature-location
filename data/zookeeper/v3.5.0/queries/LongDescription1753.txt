While pinging to the RwServer, ClientCnxn is opening a socket and using BufferedReader. These are not properly closed in finally block and could cause leaks on exceptional cases.

ClientCnxn#pingRwServer()


            try {
                Socket sock = new Socket(addr.getHostName(), addr.getPort());
                BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(
                        new InputStreamReader(sock.getInputStream()));
                ......
                sock.close();
                br.close();
            } catch (ConnectException e) {
                // ignore, this just means server is not up
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // some unexpected error, warn about it
                LOG.warn("Exception while seeking for r/w server " +
                        e.getMessage(), e);
            }
