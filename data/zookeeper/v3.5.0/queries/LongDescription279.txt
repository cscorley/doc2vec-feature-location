We would like to define certain parts of ZooKeeper's configuration using variables that get substituted. For example, we want the ZooKeeper quorum to be able to use a dataDir configured per user. In other words, something like:

tickTime=2000
dataDir=/tmp/zookeeper-$
{user.name}
clientPort=2181
initLimit=5
syncLimit=2
server.1=zoo1:2888:3888
server.2=zoo2:2888:3888
server.3=zoo3:2888:3888

I think Java already has a system for configuration that allows something like this using Properties?
